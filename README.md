# FinalProject
A repo for our final project.

## Data
[NFL Football Player Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/nfl-football-player-stats)

This data set has two JSON files, `profiles` and `games`.

We're planning to just use `games` because we only care about player statistics in a given game
and the game outcome.

### Data Trimming
The `games` file was trimmed down to only include games that have occurred since 2000 (inclusive).

This is still a large file, over GH's file size limit, so it has been stored in the repo as a ZIP file.

The goal here is to:
- Firstly, reduce our file size.
- Secondly, get more recent data.
